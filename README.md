# 💻 OOP-Calculator - First Object-Oriented Project

## About the Project

This project is a simple calculator implementation, developed entirely in the **C++** language.

What makes it significant is that this is **my very first project written entirely using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm**.

## 🎯 Educational Context

The project was created as a **seminar/laboratory assignment for university**, serving a **strictly educational purpose**. The main objective was to understand and apply the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming, such as:

* **Classes** and **Objects**.
* The principle of **Encapsulation**.
* Defining methods and private/public members.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** C++
* **Paradigms:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Functionality

The calculator supports the basic arithmetic operations:

* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

Since this is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) application written in C++, the steps are standard:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alexandrusurugiu/OOP-Calculator
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory and compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
    ```bash
    cd OOP-Calculator/
    # (The compilation command may vary depending on the internal structure and IDE/system)
    ```
3.  Run the generated executable file.
